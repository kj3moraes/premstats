# Statistical Data

All the data used here is gotten from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php). I have downloaded the CSV files and upserted them into a database.

## Raw Data

The raw data (all the individual CSV files) is found in the prem_stats_data.zip file in this directory. The zip file has all the Premier League stastics named after their respective season (for eg. 23/24 season is prem_23_24_stats.csv)

## Database Tables and Columns

To understand the database's tables and columns and the different statistics used, refer to the DETAILED_STATS.md file in this directory.
